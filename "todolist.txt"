Need to create some basic model layouts
Will start very simple
User model already exists
Will need to create a model for Manually entered notes
So far two tables, User and Notes
However... might need to have a linking table, study the Bookmark Data Model on pg 33 as this might be needed to link the User table to the Notes table
